# infinite-discord-typing

Want to make people think you're typing up a large rant, or simply think that you're present?

Run this bad boy when you're AFK, and they'll be wondering what the hell you could possibly be typing up.

At the end it will post a rudimentary message of your choice. Or not.

Unfortunately this isn't funny enough for me to figure out how to utilize win32 to send key input to discord. 

So youll either need to run this in a VM or not use your computer while this runs, as it requires discord in focus.
